inStruct is a webtool in development for the preparation of protein structures. 
The current tool includes visualization, model/chain/ligand removal, and structural repair for single atoms and chain breaks. 

Coming soon:
- options of hydrogens and protonation states
- solvent modeling
- side chain minimization
- ligand preparation tools
